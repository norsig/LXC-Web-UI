# LXC-Web-UI
Web User Interface for LXC Containers

If you use this fork please ensure to use al least lxc 1.0.4. The code was tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04.

On ubuntu 12.04 you should install:

LXC from this ppa: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-lxc/+archive/daily
python-flask from ppa: https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/python-flask
Installation on deb based system

The latest debian packages are released using packagecloud.io service since version 0.9, please update your repo config. The install script can be found at https://packagecloud.io/claudyus/LXC-Web-Panel/install

Installation of the package can be done typing:

sudo apt-get install lwp
Version released before 0.9 can be downloaded at http://claudyus.github.io/LXC-Web-Panel/download.html

Installation on rpm system or from source code

If you want to run lwp from source code or in a rpm based system like Fedora you can follow steps.

On a fedora system you should install those deps.

sudo yum update
sudo yum install lxc lxc-devel lxc-libs lxc-extra lxc-templates python-pam python-flask fabric pytz npm
Now you should download source code and inside the source code directory run this steps

fab build_assets         # build assets using python-fabric
./setup.py develop       # install python package
mkdir -p /etc/lwp        # create config/var dirs and popolate it
mkdir -p /var/lwp
cp lwp.example.conf /etc/lwp/lwp.conf
cp lwp.db /var/lwp/lwp.db
service firewalld stop   # for fedora
service lxc start        # if service lxc exists
./bin/lwp --debug        # run lwp wth debug support
Configuration

Copy /etc/lwp/lwp.example.conf to /etc/lwp/lwp.conf
edit it
start lwp service as root service lwp start
Your lwp panel is now at http://localhost:5000/ and default username and password are admin/admin.

SSL configuration

SSL direct support was dropped after v0.6 release.

You can configure nginx as reverse proxy if you want to use SSL encryption, see bug #34 for info.

Authentication methods

Default authentication is against the internal sqlite database, but it's possible to configure alternative backends.

LDAP

To enable ldap auth you should set auth type to ldap inside your config file than configure all options inside ldap section. See lwp.example.conf for references.

Pyhton LDAP need to be installed:

apt-get install python-ldap
htpasswd

To enable authentication against htpasswd file you should set auth type to htpasswd and file variable in htpasswd section to point to the htpasswd file.

This backend use the crypt function, here an example where -d force the use of crypt encryption when generating the htpasswd file:

htpasswd -d -b -c /etc/lwp/httpasswd admin admin
PAM

To enable authentication against PAM you should set auth type to pam and service variable in pam section. Python PAM module needs to be installed:

apt-get install python-pam
or

pip install pam
or

yum install python-pam
With default login service all valid linux users can login to lwp. Many more options are available via PAM Configuration, see PAM docs.

HTTP

This auth method is used to authenticate the users using an external http server through a POST request. To enable this method auth type to http and configure the option under http section.

Custom autenticators

If you want to use different type of authentication, create appropriate file in authenticators/ directory with specific structure (example can be viewed in stub authenticator)

File-bucket configuration

To enable file bucket integration for the backup routine you shoul set to true the buckets key inside the global section of configuation file. Than add a section buckets like this:

[global]
.
.
buckets = True

[buckets]
buckets_host = remote_lan_ip
buckets_port = 1234
Developers/Debug

After a fresh git clone you should download the bower component and setup the package for development purpose.

fab build_assets
sudo ./setup.py develop
cp lwp.example.conf lwp.conf
Now you can run lwp locally using sudo ./bin/lwp --debug

Debug is just one of the available options to profile lwp you can use --profiling options, those options can also be used against the global installation using: sudo lwp --debug

Anyway ensure to stop the lwp service if any: sudo service lwp stop

To run test locally unsure that mock-lxc scripts are in PATH (export PATH=`pwd`/tests/mock-lxc:$PATH) than run fab dev_test

To build a local debian package run fab debian
